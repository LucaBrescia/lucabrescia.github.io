This repo is about my first and personal website. It's about makeing a simple portfolio where i can post my project and contacts.

## Tools i used
To make this website i started following a [tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xV7S8BhIeBo "tutorial") by freecodecamp.org on youtube. Then, i make my own choices to make it personal and unique.

I also [stackoverflowed](https://stackoverflow.com/ "stackoverflowed") a lot during deployment. I've tried to make it as much responsive as i could.
The result is pretty decent i guess. Not perfect but for being the first time i got into web development i am pretty satisfied.

For the contact form i used [formsubmit](https://formsubmit.co/ "formsubmit"). Pretty cool and easy to use tool to receive mesages from website. It's free to use for small amount of monthly messages.

Lastly, i got my own domain through [Google Domains](https://domains.google.com/ "Google Domains"). Not the one i thought but it's a good compromise for this project.

Maybe, one day i'll get to a valuable website it worth buying a custom domain as it should be.
